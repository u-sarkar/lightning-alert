Q: What is the time complexity for determining if a strike has occurred for a particular asset?

A: as per the logic which I have written, for the first iteration the time complexity would be
 O(n) which means time increases when the number of assets will increase. On the subsequent
 iteration the time complexity of dictionary lookups would be constant O(1).


Q: If we put this code into production, but found it too slow, or it needed to scale to many more
users or more frequent strikes, what are the first things you would think of to speed it up?

A: For the first thing which comes in my mind to increase the speed in production is to optimize the
asset file size as bigger as possible corresponding to the working memory size.
